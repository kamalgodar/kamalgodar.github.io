I am a **Machine Learning Engineer** at Fusemachines with expertise in developing innovative AI-driven solutions. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.

I have extensive experience in Natural Language Processing, including developing Named Entity Recognition models and information extraction, building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, and working with Large Language Models. My work spans diverse applications such as **chatbot systems, recommendation systems, and document AI**. I am passionate about integrating structured and unstructured data sources to build intelligent systems that solve complex, data-driven challenges.

My research interests include developing robust **Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) detectors**, enhancing model transparency through **Explainable AI**, and optimizing decision-making processes using **Reinforcement Learning**.

I am always open to collaborating on exciting projects, sharing insights, and leveraging shared knowledge and experiences for continuous improvement in the ever-evolving field of technology.
